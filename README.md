Phishing Email Analysis Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a suspicious email to identify indicators of a phishing attack and determine whether the message should be allowed or quarantined. Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous forms of social engineering, and effective detection is critical for preventing security incidents and improving organizational defenses.
