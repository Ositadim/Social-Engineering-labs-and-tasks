Activity Overview
In this activity, you will analyze a suspicious email and identify signs of a phishing attack.
Then, you will determine whether the email should be allowed or quarantined.
Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous forms of social engineering that you’ll
encounter in the field. Identifying phishing attempts will help you prevent threats and find
ways to improve security procedures.
Scenario
Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.
You’re a security analyst at an investment firm called Imaginary Bank. An executive at the
firm recently received a spear phishing email that appears to come from the board of
Imaginary Bank. Spear phishing is a malicious email attack targeting a specific user or
group of users, appearing to originate from a trusted source. In this case, the executive is
being asked to install new collaboration software, ExecuTalk.
The executive suspects this email might be a phishing attempt because ExecuTalk was
never mentioned during the last board meeting. They've forwarded the message to your
team to verify if it’s legitimate. Your supervisor has tasked you with investigating the
message and determining whether it should be quarantined.

Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity.

actor's tactics. You can use that information to alert others at your organization about
similar messages they might receive and what to watch out for.
